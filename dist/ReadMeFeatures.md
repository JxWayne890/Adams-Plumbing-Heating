## Key Features of Your Website

### 1. **Hand-Coded from Scratch**
Your website is 100% hand-coded, meaning:

- **Better Performance**: Since there’s no unnecessary code or extra features, your site loads much faster than websites built on platforms like Wix or Squarespace.
- **Custom Design**: The layout and features are tailored to meet your business needs, not restricted by pre-made designs.

### 2. **Static Website for Speed**
Your website is a static website, meaning:
- **Fast Loading Times**: Static sites are much faster than websites built on platforms like Wix, which use bloated code and require extra server processing.

### 4. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**
To help your website rank well on Google, I’ve added:
- **Meta Titles and Descriptions**: Short summaries of your pages to make them stand out on Google.
- **Sitemap**: A file that helps search engines like Google find and list all the pages on your site.
- **robots.txt**: A file that tells search engines what’s important on your site.

This makes it easier for customers to find you online.
